Emoji Haiku Twitter Bot! [@emoji_haiku](https://www.twitter.com/emoji_haiku)

# Why Emoji Haiku? 

I'm a Django Girls organizer, and we're pretty fond of emojis. I also wanted to make a Twitter bot because it seems like the "in" thing to do right now, so why not make a bot that tweets emoji poems? 

# About emojihaiku  

- Uses the [emoji](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/emoji) python library 
- Uses [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) 
- Inspired by Liza Daly's [I Luv Recipes](https://github.com/lizadaly/i_luv_recipes) bot. 
- Emoji text from [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/). 

# About Twitter bots 

This bot was made with a lot of help from the [Build a Bot Workshop](https://tpinecone.gitbooks.io/build-a-bot-workshop/content/index.html), which I highly recommend if you'd like to build your own bot.
