Emoji Haiku Twitter Bot! [@emoji_haiku](https://www.twitter.com/emoji_haiku)

# Why Emoji Haiku? 

I'm a Django Girls organizer, and we're pretty fond of emojis. I also wanted to make a Twitter bot because it seems like the "in" thing to do right now, so why not make a bot that tweets emoji poems? 

This is a work in progress, so bear with me as I make it work.
